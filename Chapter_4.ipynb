    "### Green Tasks – REDCap ###\n",
    "\n",
    "REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is presented as an important tool commonly used in academic and clinical research settings. From the context of the chapter, REDCap fits into the broader discussion of databases because it is designed for structured data collection rather than simple calculations or visualization like spreadsheets. Unlike Excel or Google Sheets, REDCap functions as a secure, web-based database platform that allows researchers to design surveys, manage participant data, and maintain organized datasets. This makes it especially useful in healthcare and research environments where data integrity, consistency, and security are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stands out is how REDCap aligns with core database principles discussed earlier in the chapter, particularly structured storage and data integrity. REDCap helps prevent common spreadsheet problems such as accidental overwriting, inconsistent formatting, or version confusion. Since research data often involves multiple users and sensitive information, REDCap provides a controlled environment where variables are predefined, data entry is standardized, and access can be restricted. In practice, this means fewer data errors, cleaner datasets, and more reliable downstream analysis."

    "### Quiz Questions ###\n",
    "1. What is the difference between a spreadsheet and a database?\n",
    "A spreadsheet is mainly designed for calculations, small datasets, and quick data manipulation, while a database is designed for storing, managing, and querying large volumes of structured data. Databases also handle relationships between tables and provide stronger data integrity controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a spreadsheet for health data management?\n",
    "Spreadsheets are easy to use, flexible, and good for small datasets or simple analyses. However, they become inefficient and error-prone with large datasets and offer limited data integrity and multi-user controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a database for health data management?\n",
    "Databases are ideal for large datasets, maintain data integrity, and support complex queries and relationships. The downside is that they are more complex and require technical knowledge, such as SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using a spreadsheet?\n",
    "Spreadsheets can be used for calculations, sorting data, filtering variables, creating charts, and performing basic statistical summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using a database?\n",
    "Databases are used for managing large datasets, linking related tables, running complex queries, ensuring data consistency, and supporting multi-user access.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using both a spreadsheet and a database?\n",
    "Both tools can store data, allow data entry, perform basic filtering, and support some level of data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are some examples of tasks that can be performed neither a spreadsheet nor a database?\n",
    "Tasks such as advanced machine learning modeling, complex simulations, or highly specialized statistical analyses typically require dedicated software like R or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using a spreadsheet but not a database?\n",
    "Spreadsheets are better suited for quick visualizations, ad-hoc calculations, and informal exploratory analysis without needing structured schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using a database but not a spreadsheet?\n",
    "Databases handle complex table relationships, large-scale multi-user access, advanced querying, and strict data integrity enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are some examples of tasks that can be performed using both a spreadsheet and a database?\n",
    "Both can be used for organizing datasets, storing variables, retrieving records, and conducting basic data summaries."
